<p>I'm a student of Multiplatform Software Development Engineering and a passionate technology enthusiast. <br><br>
My passion for programming started in high school, where I began to stand out with small projects that opened the doors to this vast programming universe. However, it wasn't until I entered university that I started working on more elaborate projects that undoubtedly improved my performance and development as a programmer, allowing me to gain knowledge of different technologies.
  
<h2> üóª Goals for 2024</h2>
I want to enhance my skills in each of the new programming languages I'm learning at university. Additionally, I'm determined to improve my English to expand my knowledge and job opportunities.
